## Visualizing the Global Coffee Market

### Project Summary
Here I attempt to assess the state of global coffee production and consumption. The project is mainly aimed to analyze Brazil's (largest producer of coffee in the world) production relative to other countries and compare importer volume vs. the prices they pay.

**Note:**
Coffee is the second most important commercial product that is exported by developing countries, after petroleum.

### Objectives:
1. Read in data from multiple csv files.
2. Reshape the data to prepare it for visualization.
3. Build & customize charts to communicate key insights.

### The Data Set:
The data set consists of information on coffee **production** by year for major coffee producing nations, data on coffee **imports** by various nations, data on **coffee prices** and data on **prices paid to growers**.
